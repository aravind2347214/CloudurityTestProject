## Search Functionality
The search functionality allows users to search for alumni based on their name, year of graduation, and department. This feature enhances user experience by providing easy access to alumni information.

## Limitations
Due to time constraints and data unavailability, the application may not provide sufficient data for all alumni. We acknowledge this limitation and aim to improve data availability in future updates.

## Technologies Used
- React: The frontend of the application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Next.js: While primarily focusing on React, I am also exploring Next.js for server-side rendering and other advanced features. Although Next.js is still in the learning phase and not included in this project, we are excited about its potential and eager to incorporate in future projects.

## Backend
The backend of the application is powered by Node.js, a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. We use Node.js to handle server-side logic and API endpoints. Additionally, MySQL database management system is used to store and manage data related to alumni. MySQL is configured with WAMP server, providing a local development environment for database operations.
